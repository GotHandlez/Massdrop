There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  MaxPoints

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  The market consists of users with certain travel rewards credit cards that frequently use points to redeem hotel nights or airplane flights.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  This web service will provide users a convenient way of discovering what awards are available to them based on their rewards credit cards and destination of travel. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  When users travelling to some specific location have so many credit cards and amassed points, oftentimes they need to tediously check each individual hotel/airline's website to make an the most informed decision. 

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  This service centralizes all the users' credit card points so that they can see what is available to them at their travel destinations.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "This is madness! Now you can let MaxPoints determine what awards are available to you at your travel destination rather than spending hours researching yourself!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Select rewards credit card from a pre-populated, pre-approved list.
  Input the number of points.
  Enter location of travel, and dates
  Search!

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Wow! This is so convenient! This app saved me hours of tedious research in finding which hotel I'll be staying at in LA! Highly recommended!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Personal credit card information is not needed, so the service contains little to no risk in using. Due to the higher security, users should keep track and update the number of points they have inside the app.
